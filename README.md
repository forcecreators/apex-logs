# Project No Longer Active - Try Salesforce Profiler! 
Hey there Salesforce trailblazers!

Earlier this year I released a VSCode extension for visualizing and profiling logs in Salesforce. Unfortunately, with VSCode's update cycle it's been difficult to maintain the project. Luckily I found some time to re-write it as a standalone application, free of the VSCode dependency! The Salesforce Profiler now includes improved features such as both waterfall and flame charts. This new tool also features improved limits graphs; if there's a limit, there's a chart for it.

You can find installers for mac and windows (as well as source code) at (https://github.com/forcecreators/salesforce-profiler/releases/latest)
